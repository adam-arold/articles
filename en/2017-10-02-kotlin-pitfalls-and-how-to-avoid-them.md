> In this article I'll explain some of the pitfalls I encountered and try to help you avoid them.

## The mystery `null`

In Kotlin you can write your code as if `null` never existed and this can make you forget that `null` is omnipresent
but it hides. Let's look at this simple and seemingly innocent class:

```kotlin
class Foo {
    private val c: String

    init {
        bar()
        c = ""
    }

    private fun bar() {
        println(c.length)
    }
}
```

If you try to instantiate this you'll get a `NullPointerException` because `bar` tried to access the `length` of `c` before it was initialized.
Of course the application logic was flawed here but you still got an `Exception`. The worst part of this is that the IDE won't complain about this.

The takeaway here is that Kotlin *will help* you in a lot of cases (nearly all) to avoid `null`, you can't forget about it and from time to time
you'll encounter things like this.

## Handling `null`s from the JDK

Kotlin's standard library handles `null`s fine but if you use classes from the JDK you will have to handle possible `null` pointers from
library functions by hand. Most of the time the Kotlin classes are enough, but sometimes you have to use something like the `ConcurrentHashMap`.

```kotlin
val map = ConcurrentHashMap<String, String>()

map["foo"] = "bar"

val bar: String = map["foo"]!!
```

In this case you have to use the `!!` operator but in other cases the `null` safety operator (`?`) can also work.
Nevertheless if you use Java libraries extensively you'll have to litter your code with `!!`s and `?`s or write adapters for Java classes.
This is something you can't really avoid.

There is another more hideous problem you might bump into: when using methods on JDK classes which can return `null` and does not have syntactic sugar like `Map` access above. Consider the following example:

```kotlin
val queue: Queue<String> = LinkedList()

queue.peek().toInt()
```

In this case you use `peek` which in fact can return `null` but the Kotlin compiler won't complain so you can get a `NullPointerException` if your `Queue` was empty. The problem here is that we used `Queue` which is a JDK interface and if you look at the implementation of `peek`:

```java
/**
  * Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue,
  * or returns {@code null} if this queue is empty.
  *
  * @return the head of this queue, or {@code null} if this queue is empty
  */
  E peek();
```

it says that `peek` will return `E` which will lead Kotlin to believe that `E` is not nullable. This might be worked around in a future version of Kotlin but right now it *is important to keep this in mind* in your projects and use these interfaces like this:

```kotlin
val queue: Queue<String?> = LinkedList()

queue.peek()?.toInt()
```

## The inner `it`

When a lambda has a single parameter you can omit it from your code and can use `it` instead:

> it: implicit name of a single parameter
> One other helpful convention is that if a function literal has only one parameter, its declaration may be omitted (along with the ->), and its name will be it
> -- Kotlin docs

The problem with this is when you have nested functions like in this example:

```kotlin
val list = listOf("foo.bar", "baz.qux")

list.forEach {
    it.split(".").forEach {
        println(it)
    }
}
```

It only takes a few `it`s to lose track which is which. The solution to this problem is to name the parameters explicitly:

```kotlin
list.forEach { item ->
    item.split(".").forEach { part ->
        println(part)
    }
}
```

Much better!

## The insidious `copy`

Take a look at this `data class`:

```kotlin
data class Foo(val bars: MutableList<String>)
```

Data classes give you a bunch of functions and you can also make a `copy` of them. Guess what this will print out:

```kotlin
val bars = mutableListOf("foobar", "wombar")

val foo0 = Foo(bars)

val foo1 = foo0.copy()

bars.add("oops")

println(foo1.bars.joinToString())
```

This will print `foobar, wombar, oops`. The problem is that while the name indicates that `copy` will make an *actual copy* in fact it will only
copy the references in your object. This can be insidious if you forget to write an unit test and you pass your `data class`es around as if they
were immutable [value object](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html)s.

The solution to this problem is to pay attention to your `data class`es and if they should be value objects make them one:

```kotlin
data class Foo(val bars: List<String>)
```

> There is an other problem with `data class`es: you can't tell Kotlin which fields you want to put in your `equals` / `hashCode`, you can only
> `override` both and write them by hand. Keep this in mind.

## Internal leakage

Take a look at this example:

```kotlin
    class MyApi {

        fun operation0() {

        }

        internal fun hiddenOperation() {
            
        }
    }
```

If you use classes like this from other Kotlin projects the `internal` keyword will be respected. If you look at this
from a Java project however `hiddenOperation` will be `public`! To avoid this I'd suggest using `interface`s to hide
implementation details:

```kotlin
interface MyApi {

    fun operation0()
}

class MyApiImpl: MyApi {

    override fun operation0() {

    }

    internal fun hiddenOperation() {

    }
}
```

## Non-generic global extensions

The utility of extension functions is unquestionably high, but with great power comes great responsibility.
You can - for example - write extension functions to JDK classes which will be visible for the whole project.
This can be problematic when they are non-generic and represent operations which only make sense in a local context:

```kotlin
    fun String.extractCustomerName() : String {
        // ...
    }
```

Now everybody on your project will scratch their heads when they bump into this.
So I think it is good if you think twice before you write extension functions but they can be really powerful. here are some examples which might be useful:

```kotlin
/**
 * Returns an element of this [List] wrapped in an Optional
 * which is empty if `idx` is out of bounds.
 */
fun <T> List<T>.getIfPresent(idx: Int) =
        if (idx >= size) {
            Optional.empty()
        } else {
            Optional.of(get(idx))
        }

/**
 * Negates `isPresent`.
 */
fun <T> Optional<T>.isNotPresent() = isPresent.not()
```

## Unit returning lambdas vs Java SAM conversion

When you have functions which accept lambdas you can omit the `return` keyword if the lambda's return type is `Unit`:

```kotlin
fun consumeText(text: String, fn: (String) -> Unit) {

}

// usage
consumeText("foo") {
    println(it)
}
```

This is fine but if you call this from Java you'll face the awkward problem of needing to return `Unit`:

```java
consumeText("foo", (text) -> {
    System.out.println(text);
    return Unit.INSTANCE;
});
```

This is very clunky from the Java side. If you try to make this work from Java you can define an `interface`:

```kotlin
interface StringConsumer {
    fun consume(text: String)
}

fun consumeText(text: String, fn: StringConsumer) {

}
```

then you can use Java's SAM conversion to make this very simple:

```java
consumeText("foo", System.out::println);
```

but then from the Kotlin side it becomes a mess:

```kotlin
consumeText("foo", object: StringConsumer {
    override fun consume(text: String) {
        println(text)
    }
})
```

The problem is that Kotlin does not support SAM conversion for Kotlin classes and it only works with Java classes. My suggestion is that
for simple cases just use Java's built in SAM interfaces like `Consumer`:

```kotlin
fun consumeText(text: String, fn: Consumer<String>) {

}

// usage from Kotlin
consumeText("foo", Consumer {
    println(it)
})

// usage from Java
consumeText("foo", System.out::println);
```

## Java interop with unmodifiable Collections

Kotlin gives you immutable variants of the JDK's collection classes:

```kotlin
fun createSet(): Set<String> = setOf("foo")

// ...
createSet().add("bar") // oops, compile error
```

This is a very nice addition but if you look at this from the Java side you'll see the JDK's `Set` api:

```java
createSet().add("bar"); // UnsupportedOperationException
```

If you try to modify this `Set` the same will happen as if you have used Java's `Collections.unmodifiableSet()` method.
I don't know whether this can be (or should be) worked around but this is something you can keep in mind when working with Kotlin's immutable versions of Java collections.

## No overloads in interfaces

This is only an issue from an interop perspective, but Kotlin does not support the `@JvmOverloads` annotation in an `interface` and you can't use it on `override`s either:

```kotlin
interface Foo {

    @JvmOverloads // OUCH!
    fun bar(qux: String)
}

class FooImpl : Foo {
    
    @JvmOverloads // YIKES!
    override fun bar(qux: String) {
    }

}  
```

Currently the only thing you can do to have overloads is to define them by hand:

```kotlin
interface Foo {

    fun bar()

    fun bar(qux: String)
}
```

Keep it in mind though that you can suggest improvements to Kotlin itself using [KEEP](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP) (Kotlin Evolution and Enhancement Process). KEEP is something like JEP in Java, but of course KEEP has much less red tape compared to JEP.

## Conclusion

Kotlin is a very popular language right now and I **do agree** that it is a *Turbo* Java, but you should take any hype with a grain of salt. As we have seen above Kotlin has its own pitfalls which you should be aware of if you plan to use it.

All in all I think that the problems mentioned above can either be worked around easily or not critical and they don't limit the usability of the language itself.
