# Why you should open source code?

> If you have worked on a reasonably large project somewhere chances are that the thought crossed your mind sometimes about
making the code you produced available for others to use. In this article I try to sum up the Pros and the Cons about
doing so and provide a few pointers why it is useful if you have never worked on OSS before.

Working on open source software (OSS in short) on your own time is fun. You get to choose what to work on, when to do it and how to do it. If you produce something which is useful for others, people will eventually start to use it and this is where interesting things start to happen.

## Pull requests

Most of the time your users won't have the time to contribute something useful but there are some programmers who like to submit a patch or two which will provide insight to you about how your program is used. Given that you get a pull request which has reasonably good quality (fix or new feature with a bunch of unit test) you will be able to deduce a bunch of things:
- You will see __exactly__ how your program is being used
- You will know __how__ others would like to use your program
- You will gain insight to the perspective to the developer who submitted the PR. This can be incredibly useful

## Bug reports

There will be some users who won't (or can't ) contribute to your project but want to leave a comment about a problem they encountered. Most platforms which host OSS projects support this out of the box ([GitHub](https://github.com/) for example). Although they are not as useful compared to a PR you can consider them as functional tests performed for free. You will also
