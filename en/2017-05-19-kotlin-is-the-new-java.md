## So what is Kotlin?
- A home-grown programming language by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) who are the masterminds behind the acclaimed [IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) IDE and a bunch of other stuff.
- A simple and flexible alternative to Java
- Which interoperates well with existing Java code
- Compiles to Java bytecode
- Runs on the JVM
- And also compiles to javascript

If you read the docs you can see a bunch of stuff going for it:
- It lets you achieve more with less code
- Solve a lot of problems in Java
- Helps you keep using the Java ecosystem
- Lets you write front-end and back-end code in the same language
- Gives you 100% Java interoperability
- It does well compared to the alternatives (Clojure, Scala)
- Adds only a thin layer of complexity over Java

Sounds cool, right? Let's just not drinnk the Kool-Aid too soon and see some examples how well it fares compared to Java.

## Value objects vs data classes

## String interpolation

## Extension methods

## Null safety

## Type Inference

## No checked exceptions

## Lambda support

## Functional programming

## Kotlin-java interoperation

## Things to tell your boss

So if you want to give it a try here are some pointers which will help you when negotiating with your boss and teammates:
- Kotlin comes from industry, not academia. It solves problems faced by working programmers today.
- It is free and Open Source
- It comes with a useful Java to Kotlin converter tool
- You can mix Kotlin and Java with __0 effort__
- You can use *all* existing java tools/frameworks
- Kotlin is supported by the best IDE on the market (with free version)
- It is easy to read, even non-Kotlin programmers can review your code
- **You don’t need to commit** your project to Kotlin: *you can start by writing your tests in it*
- JetBrains is not likely to abandon Kotlin because it drives their sales
- Kotlin has a vibrant community and even you can easily contribute to Kotlin and suggest new features using [KEEP](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP)

So does it live up to the hype? Only you can tell.
